# MNIST_NN

A fully connected neural network writed in C for self check.
Many functions and structures are lack of planning and annotations, 
if you really want to run it, you should install Cblass libary and manually writing the `getXY()` or `getData()` functions. 

Requirement: `Cblas libary`, `your dataset`, `your loss function`, `patience` 

Lack function: `GPU support`, `accuracy calculator`, `other type network`, `Optimizer`
